A state backend server that implements the [Terraform HTTP backend API](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/http). This server does not handle authentication or TLS and should be used behind a reverse proxy (like nginx).

The server is rather an experiment in writing HTTP servers in C++. It is probably OK for hobby usage but not for mission-critical applications.

## Build

tl;dr: see [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).

1. Install required dependencies: clang++ or g++, cmake, make.
2. Install optional dependencies: [libev](http://dist.schmorp.de/libev/), [ada](https://github.com/ada-url/ada), [SQLite3](https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite), [llhttp](https://github.com/nodejs/llhttp), [sqlite3pp](https://github.com/iwongu/sqlite3pp), [json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json).
3. If you don't install the optional dependencies, the system will try to download and build them. In this case, it may need `git`, `python3`, `python3-whichcraft` (for Ada), and `tcl` (for SQlite3). See [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) for details.
4. Build: `cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel && cmake --build build`.

## Usage

The following environment variables control the server:
* `TFHTTP_ADDRESS`: IP address the server will listen on. The default value is `0.0.0.0` (listen on all IPâ€Œ addresses).
* `TFHTTP_PORT`: port the server will listen on. The default value is `3000`.
* `TFHTTP_DATABASE_NAME`: the name of the SQLite3 database where the server will store the state. By default, it is [`:memory:`](https://www.sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html), meaning its content will be lost on a restart.

## Endpoints

The server provides the following endpoints:
* `GET /:project/state`: fetch Terraform state for the given `project`. The state will be created if it does not exist.
* `POST /:project/state`: save Terraform state for the given `project`.
* `DELETE /:project/state`: delete Terraform state for the given `project`.
* `LOCK /:project`: lock state.
* `UNLOCK /:project`: unlock state.

`:project` is an alphanumeric string matching the `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+` regular expression. This makes is possible to use this server for multiple Terraform projects.

## Sample Terraform Configuration

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "http" {
    address = "http://127.0.0.1:3000/myproject/state"
    lock_address = "http://127.0.0.1:3000/myproject"
    unlock_address = "http://127.0.0.1:3000/myproject"
  }
}
```
